Welcome to the **Regression** repository! This project, developed by **Maaz Waheed**, provides a clear and concise implementation of a Linear Regression model from scratch (or using common libraries, specify which). It aims to demonstrate the fundamental concepts behind one of the most popular supervised learning algorithms.

## 📝 Overview

Linear Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. This implementation covers:


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical computations and array manipulations.
*   **Pandas:** (If used) For data loading and manipulation.
*   **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** (If used) For plotting and visualization.
*   **Scikit-learn:** (If used for comparison, dataset splitting, or metrics)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You'll also need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for demonstration and testing is the **"House Prices India"** dataset, available on Kaggle. It contains various features of houses in India, which can be used to predict their prices.

*   **Source:** [House Prices India on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/house-prices-india)
*   **Usage:** Download the dataset (e.g., `House Price India.csv`) and place it in a `data/` directory within the project, or update the data loading path in your scripts accordingly.
